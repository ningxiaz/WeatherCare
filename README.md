WeatherCare
===========

Yeah I know, another weather app. This is a small experiment of responsive design, font icons and better organization of code. It's a web app that you can use on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. It provides basic weather information, forcasts and tips after you enter the name of the places. It can be saved to homescreen on iOS devices.

### Idea
According to my habits of using weather apps, as well as some brief interviews with my friends, weather is mainly about care, with some curiosity and wonder. First, care for youself, you want to know the weather around you so you won't get wet, won't catch a cold, won't burn yourself when you do outdoor activities etc. You also check weather of the place where you'll soon be going so that you'll be prepared. Then, care for others. I check the weather in my hometown, since I care for my family. My friend track the weather where his girlfriend is travelling. Sometimes, we just wonder, how's the weather in Sydney now, ohh it's just the opposite.

So this is a weather app that cares. It cares about you, and it also hopes you'll learn to care about others, your family, your significant another, etc. 

### Implementation
Basically it's a simple one page app built from Foundation, which consists of Sass, Bower and some other amazing stuff. The weather info is from [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/API), font icons from [Weather Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/), girl icon is from NounProject. Colors referenced from [Flat UI Colors](http://flatuicolors.com/) I used "rem"s to adjust font sizes and layouts.

Unfortunately I won't have time to finish it. It could have had more functionalities.
